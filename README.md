##  Security Note
The PowerShell commands provided above pull scripts directly from the web and execute them. This can be risky if you're not entirely certain of the script's source or its content. Always ensure you trust the source and have inspected the script content before executing.

##  Additional Note
Given the default security policies on Windows, you might encounter an error like "Running scripts is disabled on this system". If this happens, you can temporarily allow the script to run with the following command, but exercise this with caution:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

This command allows scripts to run in your current session. Remember, only use this if you trust the source of the script.

If you have suggestions for improvements or bug fixes, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
